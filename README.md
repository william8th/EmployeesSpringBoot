Employees Spring Boot
=====================

This project aims to expose a RESTful web service using Spring Boot for the sample employees database provided by MySQL which can be found at [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/).

Hibernate is used mainly with annotation-based configuration to map the database to object models. More information about Hibernate can be found at [http://hibernate.org/](http://hibernate.org/).

The employees database structure is shown below:
